            Context
          </h2>
          <p>
            Professional media assets, including audio-visual masters for
            television and motion pictures, are increasingly being stored in the
            cloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a corresponding growing interest in building web
            applications that allow end-users to manipulate these assets, e.g.
            editing, quality checking, versioning, timed text authoring, etc.
            While the web platform has evolved to support consumer media applications,
            professional applications require additional capabilities, including
            precise timing, high-fidelity timed text, efficient media processing
            solutions, wide color gamut and high-dynamic range, etc.
          </p>

            What is the purpose of this workshop?
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>The workshop connects the web platform
            and the professional media production communities and explores
            evolutions of the Web platform to address professional
            media production requirements, including:</em>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Using Web technologies, like <a href="https://wicg.github.io/web-codecs/">WebCodecs</a>,
              <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/">WebGPU</a>, and
              <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/">Web Audio</a>
              for professional media production
            </li>
            <li>
              Understand the unique performance and format requirements of professional media production workflows
            </li>
            <li>
              Identify gaps in the web platform and standardization opportunities
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The workshop is scoped to professional media production using the
            web platform, including editing, quality control, grading/color
            correction, dailies, visual effects, sound, mastering, translation
            and servicing. Cloud-based processes and desktop applications that
            do not use the web platform are out of scope. Similarly,
            applications that do not manipulate the content such as file sharing
            applications are out of scope.

              proofs, as above, can pose privacy harms, particularly outside of
              professional use cases, mechanisms for limiting their use outside
              of professional contexts, making it clear when they're in use, and
              making them opt-in.
