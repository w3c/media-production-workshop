            Context
          </h2>
          <p>
            Professional media assets, including audio-visual masters for
            television and motion pictures, are increasingly being stored in the
            cloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a corresponding growing interest in building web
            applications that allow end-users to manipulate these assets, e.g.
            quality checking, versioning, timed text authoring, etc. While the
            web platform has evolved to support consumer media applications,
            professional applications require additional capabilities, including
            precise timing, high-fidelity timed text, efficient media processing
            solutions, wider color gamut and high-dynamic range, etc.
          </p>

        <section id="purpose">
          <h2>
            What is the purpose of this workshop?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The primary goals of the workshop are to <b>connect the web platform
            and the professional media production communities</b> and discuss
            evolutions of the Web platform necessary to <b>address professional
            media production requirements</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The secondary goals of the workshop are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Map professional media production needs to existing Web
              technologies where possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              Explore performance requirements and evaluate the opportunities
              for standardization to address them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Understand how upstream media production workflows may inform
              downstream Web technologies.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The workshop is scoped to professional media production using the
            web platform, including editing, quality control, grading/color
            correction, dailies, visual effects, sound, mastering, translation
            and servicing. Cloud-based processes and desktop applications that
            do not use the web platform are out of scope. Similarly,
            applications that do not manipulate the content such as file sharing
            applications are out of scope.

            W3C is a voluntary standards consortium that convenes companies and
            communities to help structure productive discussions around existing
            and emerging technologies, and offers a Royalty-Free patent framework
            for Web Recommendations. We focus primarily on client-side (browser)
            technologies, and also have a mature history of vocabulary (or
            “ontology”) development. W3C develops work based on the priorities of
            our members and our community.
