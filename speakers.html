          <h2>Who should apply to speak at the workshop?</h2>
          <p>
            W3C is convening this virtual workshop, organized jointly with
            SMPTE, to build a shared understanding of how professional
            media production scenarios intersect with Web technologies and
            help chart the Web platform's standardization roadmap in that
            space.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 id=submit>How to apply to speak?</h2>
          <p>
            If your experience or expertise in the field has provided you with
            insights (questions or answers) about this intersection, in
            particular about the <a href="./#topics">topics in scope of the
            workshop</a>, please <a href="#submit-form">submit a proposal using
            the <strong>submit a talk proposal</strong> form</a>
            <strong>as soon as possible</strong> and
            we will work with you in confirming and defining your proposed
            contribution. You may also
            <a href="mailto:group-media-production-pc@w3.org">contact the
            Program Committee directly</a> at any time if you have questions.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="why">
          <h2>Why should I apply to speak?</h2>
          <p>
            Your audience, the workshop participants, will include
            representatives from the professional media production ecosystem,
            browser vendors, media production tool vendors, media content
            providers, standards organizations representatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Web browsers are the most widely deployed platform, reaching more
            than 4 billion users across devices, and provides a key stepping
            stone to deploy tools at scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bringing your perspective to this workshop provides a unique
            opportunity to have a wide-scale and lasting impact on the future
            of media production.
          </p>
          <p>
            This will also help you establish contacts with new communities and
            new experts, expanding your network of experts and business
            relations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond the workshop itself, the record of the presentations will be
            available on the W3C site as part of the event record, and will
            serve as a point of reference and discussion for the years to come.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="what">
          <h2>What should my talk cover?</h2>
          <p>
            The Program Committee will review proposed talks to assess whether
            they fit well with the call for participation, in particular the
            list of <a href="./#topics">identified topics</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once selected, speakers should aim to provide a talk that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              brings their specific perspective on the topic,
            </li>
            <li>
              identifies what barriers may need to be lifted to make browsers a
              great platform for professional media production scenarios, in
              particular those where <strong>interoperability and
              standardization</strong> are likely to play a role,
            </li>
            <li>
              sheds light on specific aspects or questions that the Program
              Committee may have raised during their review process,
            </li>
            <li>
              raises questions of their own that other Workshop participants may
              usefully provide input on.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Talks are expected to be in the 5 to 10 minutes time range, to
            ensure that as many workshop participants as possible can watch
            the submitted talks prior to the live discussions.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="how">
          <h2>How will talks be recorded and presented?</h2>
          <p>
            Once approved by the Program Committee, talks are expected to be
            delivered as a combination of a slideset (in HTML or PDF) and a
            recorded audio or video of the speaker (<strong>without</strong>
            screen recording of the slides)
            <strong>before 15 October 2021</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            These two elements will then be synchronized and combined to allow
            Workshop participants to watch presentations at their own pace -
            see <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/06/machine-learning-workshop/talks/web_platform_a_30_000_feet_view_web_platform_and_js_environment_constraints.html">an
            example of this synchronized presentation viewer</a> for a previous
            W3C event.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can find W3C
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Virtual_Presentations">guidance on
            tools and tips</a> to record yourself. As an alternative, the
            Program Committee will offer to record speakers over a
            teleconferencing system (e.g. Zoom) both to help with technical
            matters and to provide an audience to the speaker, since we
            recognize that speaking alone in front of a camera is not
            necessarily an easy exercise.
          </p>
          <p>
            W3C also provides
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Speaker_Resources">more general
            guidance on how to present effectively</a> and
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/training/accessible.php#during">in a
            way accessible to people with disabilities</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Talks are expected to be delivered in English. Please
            <a href="mailto:group-media-production-pc@w3.org">contact the
            Program Committee</a> if you would like to submit a talk in another
            language.
          </p>
          <p>
            W3C will provide transcripts and captions for all the selected
            presentations and will ask speakers' help in reviewing these for
            accuracy.

          <h2>What other commitments are expected from me if I give a talk?</h2>
          <p>
            A few weeks after all the pre-recorded talks have been published on
            the W3C site, the Program Committee will set up a series of
            teleconferences where each of the workshop topics will get
            discussed, as informed by the submitted presentations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speakers are expected to the best of their availability to be on
            the call(s) where the topic of their presentation is being
            discussed, to answer and raise questions with other workshop
            participants.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Program Committee will also set up asynchronous communication
            mechanisms (forum, slack) where speakers are cordially invited to
            participate to exchange with other speakers and workshop
            participants.
