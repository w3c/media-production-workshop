WEBVTT

1
00:08.530 --> 00:09.520
<v Ed>It's a pleasure to be here</v>

2
00:09.520 --> 00:11.920
for today's W3C/SMPTE Joint Workshop

3
00:11.920 --> 00:14.260
on professional media production on the web.

4
00:14.260 --> 00:16.540
This talk is about the principles of accessibility

5
00:16.540 --> 00:19.690
and driving accessibility into the creation of great tools

6
00:19.690 --> 00:22.370
and apps and the web interfaces that are so critical

7
00:22.370 --> 00:24.420
to their user experience and feature set.

slide-2
00:25.530 --> 00:28.940
I'm Ed Gray, I'm a proud 26-year veteran of Avid.

9
00:28.940 --> 00:30.980
I'm the head of Avid's audio developer program,

10
00:30.980 --> 00:33.600
and also director of accessibility for the company.

11-p
00:33.600 --> 00:35.300
So I get to work with a bunch of talented,

12
00:35.300 --> 00:36.600
external and internal developers,

13
00:36.600 --> 00:39.390
testers, customer support, and marketing people.

14
00:39.390 --> 00:41.460
And I'm also the main spokesman for accessibility,

15
00:41.460 --> 00:43.760
so I organize and participate in a lot of panels

16
00:43.760 --> 00:45.930
like the ones that you see here.

17-p
00:45.930 --> 00:48.200
I have a CPACC credential, which allows me to consult

18
00:48.200 --> 00:51.400
to organizations on accessibility for their websites

19
00:51.400 --> 00:53.320
and stores and physical plant.

20-p
00:53.320 --> 00:55.350
And finally, I'm legally blind myself,

21
00:55.350 --> 00:58.140
so any accessibility goodness that we crank out,

22
00:58.140 --> 00:59.940
I'll be the first in line to try it.

slide-3
01:00.820 --> 01:02.270
Now, the business case for accessibility,

24
01:02.270 --> 01:04.180
your tools and web interfaces is strong,

25
01:04.180 --> 01:05.600
but it's not always obvious,

26
01:05.600 --> 01:06.670
just by looking at the market size.

27
01:06.670 --> 01:08.995
Now, the incidents of accessibility

28
01:08.995 --> 01:12.400
in developed countries is around 15%.

29
01:12.400 --> 01:14.150
And then zeroing in on visual impairments,

30
01:14.150 --> 01:15.440
around three-quarters of percent

31
01:15.440 --> 01:16.910
of people can't see the screen well enough

32
01:16.910 --> 01:18.330
to do any reasonable work.

33
01:18.330 --> 01:21.140
And another 3 to 4% can view the screen

34
01:21.140 --> 01:23.450
with some difficulty with some visual aids.

35-p
01:23.450 --> 01:24.350
So you can imagine that

36
01:24.350 --> 01:26.490
if you're trying to justify a project based

37
01:26.490 --> 01:28.150
on that small portion of the population,

38
01:28.150 --> 01:29.800
it's not always that easy to do.

39
01:29.800 --> 01:31.420
But the important points to remember,

40
01:31.420 --> 01:34.750
that accessible innovation helps abled-users too.

41
01:34.750 --> 01:36.790
And that accessibility helps build your brand

42
01:36.790 --> 01:39.787
and your reputation and creates goodwill

43
01:39.787 --> 01:42.860
and brings a lot of people to the media creation party.

44-p
01:42.860 --> 01:44.630
And finally, accessible development

45
01:44.630 --> 01:48.300
is just development for usability for disabled persons.

46
01:48.300 --> 01:49.840
And so accessible development can help you

47
01:49.840 --> 01:53.440
uncover usability fixes and improvements

48
01:53.440 --> 01:54.740
that can benefit everyone.

slide-4
01:55.690 --> 01:57.660
So let's talk about some principles and trends

50
01:57.660 --> 01:58.610
that you should keep in mind

51
01:58.610 --> 02:01.130
if you're becoming a student of accessibility.

52
02:01.130 --> 02:02.440
And this gives me a chance to show

53
02:02.440 --> 02:04.220
and to brag about my picture of Stevie Wonder.

54
02:04.220 --> 02:06.720
Here he is at the 2017 GRAMMY Awards,

55
02:06.720 --> 02:09.200
saying, make everything accessible for everyone,

56
02:09.200 --> 02:11.880
everywhere in the world, no matter what disabilities.

57
02:11.880 --> 02:12.760
And what he was speaking to

58
02:12.760 --> 02:14.930
is the principle of universal design.

59
02:14.930 --> 02:17.950
Universal design just means one tool for everybody,

60
02:17.950 --> 02:20.340
instead of one version of the app for the blind users,

61
02:20.340 --> 02:21.550
and another for the sighted folks,

62
02:21.550 --> 02:23.630
and one version of your website for people

63
02:23.630 --> 02:25.660
with motor disabilities, one without.

64-p
02:25.660 --> 02:27.647
You want one tool that people can all walk up to

65
02:27.647 --> 02:30.380
and use in the same facility, in the same way.

66
02:30.380 --> 02:33.300
And that's a very important guiding principle.

67-p
02:33.300 --> 02:34.970
And accessibility is also legally driven

68
02:34.970 --> 02:37.600
because whether or not it's wise or fair,

69
02:37.600 --> 02:40.100
people are being hit with accessibility inquiries,

70
02:40.100 --> 02:41.510
and sometimes lawsuits demanding

71
02:41.510 --> 02:44.770
that they improve the accessibility of their products.

72
02:44.770 --> 02:47.780
And as long as the company has a team committed

73
02:47.780 --> 02:50.830
to accessibility, shows a record of accessible innovation,

74
02:50.830 --> 02:53.290
and a place to ask questions about accessibility,

75
02:53.290 --> 02:56.290
they will be pretty well protected.

76-p
02:56.290 --> 02:58.140
Accessibility is also procurement driven,

77
02:58.140 --> 03:01.720
meaning that in our space, in the media production space,

78
03:01.720 --> 03:03.980
there are schools and institutions

79
03:03.980 --> 03:06.710
that won't consider committing to purchases

80
03:06.710 --> 03:08.590
unless you establish that your product

81
03:08.590 --> 03:09.660
is decently accessible.

82-p
03:09.660 --> 03:10.493
That's usually done

83
03:10.493 --> 03:12.830
with a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template,

84
03:12.830 --> 03:16.260
which is a document that you fill out independently

85
03:16.260 --> 03:18.500
that shows what features

86
03:18.500 --> 03:19.970
of your product meet, partially meet

87
03:19.970 --> 03:22.500
and do not meet certain accessibility standards.

88-p
03:22.500 --> 03:25.200
And then finally, accessibility is external,

89
03:25.200 --> 03:26.570
beta tester and engineer driven.

90
03:26.570 --> 03:29.870
So you don't want your accessibility features prioritized

91
03:29.870 --> 03:34.870
and pursued by a group of empathetic, sighted engineers,

92
03:35.520 --> 03:38.530
you want people with different disabilities giving input

93
03:38.530 --> 03:41.840
and showing you how they work around real-world problems,

94
03:41.840 --> 03:43.750
they can help you prioritize fixes

95
03:43.750 --> 03:45.100
in the most meaningful way.

slide-5
03:46.540 --> 03:48.810
The website front end to your application are tools

97
03:48.810 --> 03:50.380
like a mailbox at the foot of the driveway,

98
03:50.380 --> 03:52.125
gives you the impression of how it'll be used

99
03:52.125 --> 03:54.350
and what the overall experience will be like.

100-p
03:54.350 --> 03:56.470
So if it's not a winner for accessibility,

101
03:56.470 --> 03:59.120
it can be a killer, can render parts of the app invisible

102
03:59.120 --> 04:01.600
or inaccessible by assisted devices

103
04:01.600 --> 04:03.600
for people with motor challenges.

104-p
04:03.600 --> 04:04.790
And so there's some tools that come to the rescue

105
04:04.790 --> 04:07.830
from the WCAG, the Web Content Accessibility Group,

106
04:07.830 --> 04:09.810
which is part of the W3C.

107
04:09.810 --> 04:12.990
And they show checklist of accessibility features

108
04:12.990 --> 04:15.300
that can or must be implemented

109
04:15.300 --> 04:17.740
to meet certain accessibility standards,

110
04:17.740 --> 04:20.500
and give you guidelines on how to pursue them.

111
04:20.500 --> 04:21.850
And the important thing is that these are pursued, again,

112
04:21.850 --> 04:25.210
by a diverse group of internal and external stakeholders

113
04:25.210 --> 04:27.240
with and without disabilities.

114-p
04:27.240 --> 04:29.690
Now, this is an example of an accessibility audit.

115
04:29.690 --> 04:32.660
So companies should audit their accessibility capabilities

116
04:32.660 --> 04:33.980
from time to time, you know, quarterly,

117
04:33.980 --> 04:38.810
or at least semi-annually to see how things are progressing.

118
04:38.810 --> 04:41.370
And it is not a one-and-done effort,

119
04:41.370 --> 04:44.400
but should be a sustained ongoing effort

120
04:45.600 --> 04:46.960
that represents a longterm commitment.

slide-6
04:47.970 --> 04:49.660
I encourage you as often as you can,

122
04:49.660 --> 04:52.280
to look at developer programs

123
04:52.280 --> 04:56.150
and explore their sections that deal with accessibility,

124
04:56.150 --> 04:59.500
and also to check out the many web resources

125
04:59.500 --> 05:02.600
that help you keep on top of what's new and what's next

126
05:02.600 --> 05:03.840
in the world of accessibility.

127-p
05:03.840 --> 05:05.690
They fall into a couple of categories.

128
05:05.690 --> 05:07.130
Corporate accessibility websites,

129
05:07.130 --> 05:09.770
usually if you type in the URL of a tech company,

130
05:09.770 --> 05:11.430
you type /accessibility,

131
05:11.430 --> 05:14.810
you'll be taken to a developer website that shows tools

132
05:14.810 --> 05:16.850
and how to get help and ask questions

133
05:16.850 --> 05:19.350
and shows you accessibility success stories.

134-p
05:19.350 --> 05:21.960
Next are communities of practice like the IAAP,

135
05:21.960 --> 05:23.217
the International Association

136
05:23.217 --> 05:25.280
of Accessibility Professionals,

137
05:25.280 --> 05:28.220
and WebAIM, which stands for Web Access In Mind.

138-p
05:28.220 --> 05:32.700
There are also very good courses offered by schools,

139
05:32.700 --> 05:33.580
and a good place to look for them

140
05:33.580 --> 05:35.840
is Coursera and also Skillshare.

141
05:35.840 --> 05:38.560
They have courses ranging from introductions

142
05:38.560 --> 05:41.390
to accessibility program on the web

143
05:41.390 --> 05:45.470
to building accessibility teams in your companies.

144-p
05:45.470 --> 05:48.120
And the fourth category are accessibility consultancies.

145
05:48.120 --> 05:51.470
They offer, they do a lot of content creation

146
05:51.470 --> 05:54.600
and have webinars on accessibility topics.

147
05:54.600 --> 05:57.160
But be mindful, one of their main objectives

148
05:57.160 --> 05:59.500
is to send a bot to your website

149
05:59.500 --> 06:02.460
to search for accessibility defects

150
06:02.460 --> 06:04.180
and then sell you consulting services.

151
06:04.180 --> 06:08.440
And that's no substitute for an accessibility program

152
06:08.440 --> 06:10.420
at your company that's fully resourced

153
06:10.420 --> 06:12.300
and designed for the longterm.

slide-7
06:13.440 --> 06:15.220
So why are we so interested in accessibility?

155
06:15.220 --> 06:17.430
Well, I think the WCAG expresses it in the right way.

156
06:17.430 --> 06:20.100
They say that they want just to make interfaces

157
06:20.100 --> 06:22.140
that are perceivable, operable and understandable

158
06:22.140 --> 06:24.230
by the widest possible range of users.

159
06:24.230 --> 06:26.680
And also robust, so they stand up to and take advantage

160
06:26.680 --> 06:29.150
of platforms and operating systems

161
06:29.150 --> 06:30.820
as they evolve from time to time.

162-p
06:30.820 --> 06:32.700
This involves a commitment to universal design,

163
06:32.700 --> 06:34.270
again, one version of the app for everyone,

164
06:34.270 --> 06:35.190
not different versions

165
06:35.190 --> 06:38.000
for different disabled subpopulations.

166-p
06:38.000 --> 06:41.340
It involves us creating experiences that are customizable

167
06:41.340 --> 06:44.620
by end-users 'cause not all people are cognitively disabled

168
06:44.620 --> 06:47.940
or blind or hearing-impaired in the same manner.

169-p
06:47.940 --> 06:52.240
So you want things to be able to be tailored

170
06:52.240 --> 06:55.770
and you want to, again, involve a diverse community

171
06:55.770 --> 06:59.100
of internal and external stakeholders,

172
06:59.100 --> 07:02.560
so you can get to the right sweet spot of issues

173
07:02.560 --> 07:03.680
and address the issues

174
07:03.680 --> 07:07.120
that solve problems the most meaningfully.

175-p
07:07.120 --> 07:09.260
If we do this, we'll be doing a great service.

176
07:09.260 --> 07:12.962
And then I encourage you to find people you love

177
07:12.962 --> 07:15.510
with disabilities and people in your community,

178
07:15.510 --> 07:18.820
and lead them to these accessibility innovations

179
07:18.820 --> 07:21.310
and teach them what's going on.

180
07:21.310 --> 07:23.760
Because I guarantee you that not all disabled people

181
07:23.760 --> 07:27.100
are as capable or as willing

182
07:27.100 --> 07:31.400
to discover accessible innovations as we might think.

183-p
07:31.400 --> 07:34.100
And so if we do that, we'll be doing a great service.

184
07:34.100 --> 07:37.300
And again, we're part of the media creation business.

185
07:37.300 --> 07:39.820
And I think that it's a wonderful thing we're doing

186
07:39.820 --> 07:42.900
to involve more and more people

187
07:42.900 --> 07:46.760
in the use of our creation tools, and creating goodwill

188
07:46.760 --> 07:48.660
and building our reputations and brands

189
07:48.660 --> 07:50.760
and building better products for everyone.

slide-8
07:52.510 --> 07:54.490
So let me wrap it all up with a treat for you.

191
07:54.490 --> 07:55.860
This is Jason Dasent,

192
07:55.860 --> 07:59.150
he's the owner of Overdrive Recording in Trinidad.

193
07:59.150 --> 08:02.590
He is a key advisor and consultant to Avid

194
08:02.590 --> 08:05.190
and other companies on accessibility.

195
08:05.190 --> 08:06.720
He is completely blind.

196
08:06.720 --> 08:10.910
So here he is working on some Caribbean music tracks

197
08:10.910 --> 08:13.500
independently and without sighted assistance.

198-p
08:13.500 --> 08:14.510
We owe him a great deal.

199
08:14.510 --> 08:16.920
You can see that he moves through Pro Tools

200
08:16.920 --> 08:20.810
and other products with the same speed and facility,

201
08:20.810 --> 08:23.650
as people with normal eyesight.

202
08:23.650 --> 08:26.270
And it's the same version of Pro Tools

203
08:26.270 --> 08:27.843
that the sighted users have.

204-p
08:29.476 --> 08:32.643
(upbeat reggae music)

205-p
08:36.310 --> 08:37.890 line:15%
<v ->Hey guys, I'm Jay,</v>

206
08:37.890 --> 08:40.260 line:15%
a producer from Trinidad in the Caribbean,

207
08:40.260 --> 08:42.150 line:15%

And today's a really special day.

209
08:43.820 --> 08:45.850
I'm getting to hang out with Avid, right,

210
08:45.850 --> 08:48.830
my friends at Avid, talking about the Carbon

211
08:48.830 --> 08:51.980
and the Vintage Organ plugins

212
08:51.980 --> 08:54.130
that comes with it from Native Instruments.

213-p
08:56.000 --> 08:58.520
Okay, so nothing is quantized or anything yet, right?

214
08:58.520 --> 09:00.950
I'll do it after, because I just want to go

215
09:00.950 --> 09:03.140
like on the spur of the moment, whatever I'm feeling,

216
09:03.140 --> 09:04.820
we can definitely clean it up after.

217-p
09:04.820 --> 09:06.950
But that's the organ and some drums.

218
09:06.950 --> 09:08.000
Let's get a bassline.

219
09:09.220 --> 09:12.622
Let's hit record and see what it gives.

220-p
09:12.622 --> 09:14.738
(metronome starts)

221-p
09:14.738 --> 09:19.710
(Jason playing upbeat reggae music)

09:41.340 --> 09:42.710
<v Ed>Well, I sure appreciate your time,</v>

09:42.710 --> 09:44.190
and I hope you enjoyed this talk.

224
09:44.190 --> 09:46.400
If you have any questions about this document

225
09:46.400 --> 09:48.520
or the work that Avid's doing on accessibility,

226
09:48.520 --> 09:50.870
or just want to share some cool ideas,

227
09:50.870 --> 09:53.740
just write to meet accessibility@avid.com.

Thank you again.
