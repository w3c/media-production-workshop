Hello

2
00:06.700 --> 00:06.710
I am He Zhi

3
00:07.700 --> 00:12.700
the web-based media production team leader from China Mobile Migu Company.

slide-2
00:12.700 --> 00:22.700
Today, I would like to share the application of Migu web editing technology in live and post production for sports broadcasting.

slide-3
00:23.700 --> 00:26.700
During the UEFA Euro2020

6
00:26.700 --> 00:28.700
and the Tokyo2020

7
00:28.700 --> 00:35.700
web-based technologies have been largely deployed for live and post production.

8
00:35.700 --> 00:40.700
The application tools are mainly divided into three categories,

9
00:40.700 --> 00:43.700
live broadcast and streaming,

10
00:43.700 --> 00:45.700
post production and editing,

11
00:45.700 --> 00:47.700
and AI enhanced production.

12-p
00:48.700 --> 00:54.700
These tools are implemented based on HTML5 and ffmpeg technology.

13
00:55.700 --> 00:59.700
The below tables list used protocols and technologies.

slide-4
01:01.700 --> 01:07.700
OK, let us look at the live broadcast editing tool. The favorite function is to strip and publish.

15
01:08.700 --> 01:12.700
In order to produce and publish video within 30s,

16
01:13.700 --> 01:15.700
we have made lots of improvements.

17-p
01:16.700 --> 01:22.700
First, uniformly recode live stream as HLS with ffmpeg,

18
01:22.700 --> 01:26.700
and slice each ts file within 2 seconds;

19
01:26.700 --> 01:35.700
The second is to quickly compress 720p low bit stream for web browsing and editing;

20
01:36.700 --> 01:38.700
Third, provide key frame pictures,

21
01:39.700 --> 01:46.700
which are displayed by DOM on the operation track to facilitate interception and location;

22
01:46.700 --> 01:55.700
Fourth, add video JS playback object to quickly browse the content after simulated strip removal;

23
01:56.700 --> 02:04.700
Fifth, use background services for parallel processing to improve performance;

24
02:04.700 --> 02:06.700
Sixth, CDN cache is used.

25-p
02:07.700 --> 02:11.700
And there is still an ongoing issue, which is,

26
02:12.700 --> 02:16.700
there are two video JS objects with two play windows,

27
02:16.700 --> 02:19.700
both need to download m3u8 files.

28
02:20.700 --> 02:24.700
We hope that they can share data to avoid repeated

29
02:24.700 --> 02:27.700
downloading and save network bandwidth,

30
02:27.700 --> 02:35.700
so that we can open more windows and preview the contents in different periods at the same time.

slide-5
02:36.700 --> 02:38.700
OK, let us turn to the post editing.

32
02:38.700 --> 02:43.700
It could be regarded as an upgrade of live editing tool.

33
02:44.700 --> 02:47.700
Here we no longer pursue timeliness, but professionalism.

34-p
02:48.700 --> 02:56.700
We need control different types of content through complex multi-track object and display them by canvas.

35
02:57.700 --> 03:01.700
The difficulty here lies in the processing performance and efficiency.

36
03:02.700 --> 03:03.700
How to achieve?

37-p
03:04.700 --> 03:06.700
Firstly, for the whole architecture,

38
03:06.700 --> 03:14.700
it keeps the way of web simulating with final processing by media services to reduce the web load.

39
03:14.700 --> 03:23.700
Secondly, we try to control the window resolution of the displayed content at 480 * 270.

40
03:24.700 --> 03:34.700
This is because rendering special effect at high resolution by WebGL takes ordinary laptop 80% CPU;

41
03:35.700 --> 03:40.700
Thirdly, in order to preview content without delay by mouse hover,

42
03:40.700 --> 03:45.700
we recode content as HLS with ffmpeg during uploading;

43
03:46.700 --> 03:47.700
Finally, there are some operation optimization points,

44
03:47.700 --> 04:01.700
such as providing a small H5 editing window for users to preprocess and cut the required content when uploading.

45-p
04:01.700 --> 04:05.700
We have tried to implement with Webcodecs,

46
04:05.700 --> 04:11.700
which is very convenient, but it needs to be processed frame by frame.

47
04:12.700 --> 04:16.700
I have to say, it is not very friendly to locate and clip content.

48
04:17.700 --> 04:21.700
The easy way is webassembly + ffmpeg.

49
04:22.700 --> 04:27.700
We expect that webcodecs could support more such kinds of functions.

slide-6
04:29.700 --> 04:32.700
OK, in order to meet the different needs of editing,

51
04:32.700 --> 04:36.700
we have also developed a series of tool sets,

52
04:37.700 --> 04:40.700
including image editing, cover production, subtitle production,

53
04:40.700 --> 04:49.700
video template, horizontal to vertical screen, removing watermark tools and so on.

54
04:50.700 --> 04:53.700
Due to the web framework and modular design,

55
04:53.700 --> 04:57.700
it makes most of basic capabilities reusable,

56
04:57.700 --> 05:03.700
and it could easily implement incremental functions.

slide-7
05:03.700 --> 05:09.700
On the whole, we choose W/S architecture of the light front and heavy back,

58
05:09.700 --> 05:12.700
which is mainly due to three reasons.

59
05:14.700 --> 05:16.700
First, there are the performance issue mentioned above;

60
05:17.700 --> 05:24.700
second, for flexibility, light front can be easily integrated into commercial applications;

61
05:25.700 --> 05:27.700
the third is for compatibility.

62
05:28.700 --> 05:33.700
Background services can provide API for various terminals on cloud.

63
05:34.700 --> 05:43.700
OK, we could achieve quickly business integration, strong reusability, and easy expansion.

slide-8
05:43.700 --> 05:46.700
In order to produce more content with low cost,

65
05:47.700 --> 05:51.700
we add AI functions, such as automatically add label,

66
05:51.700 --> 05:56.700
automatically add subtitles, automatically remove watermark,

67
05:56.700 --> 06:03.700
automatically turn horizontal to vertical screen, automatically cut video, and so on.

slide-9
06:04.700 --> 06:12.700
Finally, let's look back and see why we choose web editing technology for online operation and production platform.

69-p
06:13.700 --> 06:17.700
Take a media company with 200 employees as example.

70
06:17.700 --> 06:21.700
The first is the need of copyright. Through web editing,

71
06:21.700 --> 06:26.700
we can minimize the risk of content copy, download and disclosure.

72
06:27.700 --> 06:35.700
The second is the need of operation. Users could save a lot of time by online modification

73
06:35.700 --> 06:37.700
and resubmission the content for operation.

74
06:37.700 --> 06:41.700
The third is R&amp;D needs. As mentioned above, for better performance,

75
06:42.700 --> 06:50.700
flexibility and compatibility. Fourth, for the cost. Compared with purchasing workstations,

76
06:50.700 --> 06:55.700
web editing can save more than 80% of cost with shared cloud servers;

77
06:56.700 --> 07:03.700
Fifth, the construction and maturity cycle is shorter, which can save 70% of time.

78-p
07:04.700 --> 07:12.700
Online operation and production platform could be used to produce and operate large number of music,

79
07:12.700 --> 07:20.700
videos, and movies and live broadcasts, and plays a core role in the content production system.

slide-10
07:21.700 --> 07:23.700
We are full of expectations.

81
07:24.700 --> 07:29.700
We expect that webcodecs can provide more functions and API,

82
07:30.700 --> 07:33.700
such as, support video JS object sharing data,

83
07:34.700 --> 07:42.700
support location, cutting media, and support high-resolution special effect rendering with low CPU cost,

84
07:42.700 --> 07:49.700
support RMVB \ AVI \ MKV and other common network video format,

85
07:49.700 --> 07:59.700
And support h265 \ VP9 encoding and decoding for ultra-high definition of 4K \ 8K video in the future

slide-11
08:00.700 --> 08:01.700
Thank you, thank you very much.
