00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
<v Steve>From 5th Kind, and welcome</v>

2
00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:03.000
to the production metaverse.

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.090
Today, we're gonna walk through,

4
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.000
what is the production metaverse?

5
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.930
How is metadata used to orchestrate the pipeline

6
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.720
of a studio and a production?

7
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.910
What are some of the unique challenges?

8
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.530
And how is it used in a virtual production

9
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.400
across these studios?

10-p
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.437
Just to start off with some of the foundation

11
00:00:19.437 --> 00:00:21.780
of what a production process looks like,

12
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.330
it really starts with a script, the foundation of the story.

13
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.080
From there you build out research,

14
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.100
where you're pulling images from the web,

15
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.935
you're building unique pieces of content

16
00:00:30.935 --> 00:00:33.268
with storyboards and concept art,

17
00:00:33.268 --> 00:00:35.850
you're doing scouting and location photos

18
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.150
from around the world,

19
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.370
set design with architectural drawings,

20
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.070
casting with a whole range of other content.

21-p
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.431
Then as you go into shooting, you're gonna be capturing

22
00:00:45.431 --> 00:00:48.890
all sorts of different resolutions at high frame rates,

23
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.650
and potentially multiple cameras

24
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.670
across multiple units in multiple locations.

25
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.974
It's not uncommon for a production to generate

26
00:00:55.974 --> 00:00:58.760
hundreds of terabytes, if not petabytes,

27
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.250
in a number of months,

28
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.001
and require that all of that content be uploaded

29
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.820
into the cloud, distributed out to multiple vendors,

30
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.690
all working on that content in different ways

31
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.100
and at different phases,

32
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.920
and different needs for the production process.

33-p
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.140
Editorial will then cut that all together

34
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.990
and connect all those VFX vendors and all those VFX layers

35
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.830
and elements that come together,

36
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.976
and all the while feeding the marketing machine

37
00:01:23.976 --> 00:01:27.619
and the licensing machine up into the studio.

38-p
00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.360
As I said, the foundation really starts with the script.

39
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.860
And what's interesting is a script is a structured document,

40
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.687
you have scenes on the left, exterior, interior,

41
00:01:36.687 --> 00:01:41.560
day/night labels, story locations, characters, et cetera,

42
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.200
all consistently structured in this document.

43-p
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.610
Taking that foundation as we expand out

44
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.820
from the story location into, say,

45
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.820
the physical location of where is that set gonna be a shot,

46
00:01:54.078 --> 00:01:59.078
or are they gonna create it in a particular stage?

47
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.370
You also have virtual elements with sequences and shots,

48
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.160
so how's the visual effects department going to break down

49
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.980
the information, and how does this all connect together

50
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.103
into this actual production metaverse?

51-p
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.860
Even going deeper into VFX,

52
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.580
if you take, say, a particular shot,

53
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.080
it's broken up into hundreds, if not thousands, of frames,

54
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.130
and there's layers to those frames,

55
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.540
maybe a foreground plate or a background plate.

56
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.850
That foreground plate could be made up of models

57
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.660
and rigs and textures,

58
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.100
and combined with footage to come together

59
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.453
just to create a couple of seconds of a beautiful image.

60-p
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.510
And as an example,

61
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.020
we could use maybe a foreground plate of a guy on a horse.

62
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.229
Whack in a background layer, some smoke and some people

63
00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:47.654
and fire, I'll light it, color it,

64
00:02:47.654 --> 00:02:49.760
and you get this beautiful image.

65
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.360
So if you can think of that happening thousands,

66
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.168
if not tens of thousands of times across all of these

67
00:02:55.168 --> 00:02:59.320
millions of frames, thousands of shots and

68
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.097
distributed globally to create this one piece of content

69
00:03:02.097 --> 00:03:04.823
and surrounding articles.

70-p
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.680
So what's important is you get a consistent framework of how

71
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.820
to structure that information from the file metadata,

72
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.590
to how the files are structured within assets,

73
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.490
the connective tissue of how a character is connected

74
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.790
to an actor, leveraging AI analysis for automation of that

75
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.150
as much as possible,

76
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.250
connecting a shot to a vendor through external databases

77
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.563
like File Maker, Ftrack or a shotgun database.

78-p
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.770
How you pull in the pillars from all different phases

79
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.590
of production from casting and pre-production

80
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.590
to camera on set, to the editorial of post and the archive,

81
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.312
all the way into the metaverse and into entities.

82-p
00:03:45.312 --> 00:03:48.600
So we leverage all this data to orchestrate the pipeline

83
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.162
of status changes and triggering events for transcodes

84
00:03:52.162 --> 00:03:54.910
and file transfers with different applications

85
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.410
in different events, all in the need of moving this data

86
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.548
as fast as possible to give creatives as much time

87
00:04:01.548 --> 00:04:04.870
to make those decisions before they hit that deadline.

88-p
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.670
That's one interesting thing about production

89
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.256
is you've got a release date

90
00:04:08.256 --> 00:04:10.240
and the goal is how can you create

91
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.782
the greatest film possible in that amount of time?

92
00:04:12.782 --> 00:04:17.218
So functionally our role is to help facilitate

93
00:04:17.218 --> 00:04:20.370
the orchestration, the speed of decisions,

94
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.423
and creative flow as much as possible.

95-p
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.700
And so some of the key challenges that we find through

96
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.453
browsers is things like dealing with big file sizes

97
00:04:29.453 --> 00:04:32.902
and the need for UDP acceleration of large file

98
00:04:32.902 --> 00:04:35.687
transfers distributed globally around the world.

99
00:04:35.687 --> 00:04:37.230
When you've gotta be uploading, you know,

100
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.130
many terabytes overnight, and it's required to be delivered

101
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.630
in a location for that next, you know, artist

102
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.400
to work on it, you just really need the robustness

103
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.261
of commonly used tools like (?) and Asignet

104
00:04:48.261 --> 00:04:51.160
but to be able to get native support in the browser

105
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.993
would be amazing.

106-p
00:04:51.993 --> 00:04:54.920
Upload folders, uploading folders, of course,

107
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.895
many challenges there in a browser right now,

108
00:04:56.895 --> 00:05:00.993
you know, structured files, like a model

109
00:05:00.993 --> 00:05:03.500
that has a certain relationship to a rig

110
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.380
and a texture maintaining those structures,

111
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.685
commonly requires people to zip things up

112
00:05:08.685 --> 00:05:12.363
and then have them decompress, you know, on upload.

113-p
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.950
Those robust transfers across a long haul, you know,

114
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.950
globally distributed teams where you're shooting

115
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.190
in New Zealand and your post house is in LA

116
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.670
and the effects house is in the UK, et cetera,

117
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.028
just being able to move data really fast is required,

118
00:05:26.028 --> 00:05:29.548
especially on location, the idea of sort of drop zones

119
00:05:29.548 --> 00:05:32.860
of how do you find that, a big pipe to get the data

120
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.080
to where you need as fast as possible.

121-p
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.910
And we also see a lot of duplication of files.

122
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.360
You know, if there was the possibility

123
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.612
of a client-side checksum

124
00:05:40.612 --> 00:05:43.940
where you would get a computable, a fingerprint,

125
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.859
to realize you've already got that file in your system,

126
00:05:45.859 --> 00:05:48.650
because we're moving so many files around

127
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:49.635
in different locations,

128
00:05:49.635 --> 00:05:53.783
just to be able to exchange a common hash,

129
00:05:53.783 --> 00:05:56.618
would just allow for a lot faster transfers

130
00:05:56.618 --> 00:05:59.123
with electric packet data.

131-p
00:05:59.123 --> 00:06:02.500
And editing, of course, the hybrid nature of being

132
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.529
on prim, on location, in a studio, in the home,

133
00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:08.830
orchestrating that data, getting it to where it needs to be

134
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.457
in a reasonable amount of time.

135
00:06:10.457 --> 00:06:13.750
You know, this is also driving the need to bring the desktop

136
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.800
to the data or the desktop in the cloud.

137
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.990
So accelerating the needs of common operating system

138
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.610
and common applications to run directly in the cloud

139
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.340
is accelerating.

140
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.420
And a lot of challenges dealing with rural media costs,

141
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.554
constantly requiring, you know, transcoding,

142
00:06:30.554 --> 00:06:35.353
very difficult to protect with any form of watermarking.

143-p
00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:38.610
Now with playback, we've seen a good evolution,

144
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.885
obviously on the browsers, as we've seen, you know,

145
00:06:40.885 --> 00:06:45.050
many video technologies accelerate with fragmented MP4s

146
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.374
and low-latency streaming live is accelerating across

147
00:06:48.374 --> 00:06:51.750
this industry right now, but the need for higher bit rates,

148
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.802
higher fidelity, you know, 5.1 audio, et cetera,

149
00:06:54.802 --> 00:06:57.640
is definitely a higher requirement.

150
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.200
You know, visual and forensic watermarking have always been

151
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.631
the fundamentals of what we do.

152-p
00:07:01.631 --> 00:07:04.650
We used to be able to have a, you know,

153
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.040
compiled container back in the days when flash

154
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.040
was semi-secure and allowed you to have a DRM

155
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.626
protected stream with the client side overlay

156
00:07:16.626 --> 00:07:20.030
that allowed you to leverage things like CDNs

157
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.880
for, you know, optimize, you know, streaming.

158
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.827
As we have lost that and, you know, WebAssembly

159
00:07:26.827 --> 00:07:29.650
has not really replaced it in its ability,

160
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.368
from a security perspective, to create a secure container.

161
00:07:32.368 --> 00:07:36.475
It has required a lot of server-side watermarking to occur,

162
00:07:36.475 --> 00:07:38.530
which then of course, you know,

163
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.161
creates more challenges with buffering.

164-p
00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:45.228
And VR 360, you know, just being able to play that back

165
00:07:45.228 --> 00:07:48.794
with DRM, being able to maintain security as we move

166
00:07:48.794 --> 00:07:53.600
into more of these virtual worlds is gonna be critical.

167-p
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.041
And then just for distribution, just offline tracking

168
00:07:56.041 --> 00:07:57.928
tends to come up a lot, the security,

169
00:07:57.928 --> 00:08:01.580
when things go offline, how can we keep, you know,

170
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.080
some protection within the operating system or handoff

171
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.548
between the browser and the operating system,

172
00:08:06.548 --> 00:08:08.595
being able to download folders

173
00:08:08.595 --> 00:08:10.780
so that you can maintain those structures,

174
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.140
as we talked about the challenges on upload,

175
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.556
and then just, you know, leveraging audio and AI analysis

176
00:08:15.556 --> 00:08:17.806
at scale, I think is going in the right direction

177
00:08:17.806 --> 00:08:20.870
and we'll be leveraging a lot more of that going forward.

178-p
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.714
So I hope you found that useful, as you know,

179
00:08:22.714 --> 00:08:27.010
some of the pipelines and tools used in the orchestration

180
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.210
of a studio and some of the challenges we run into

181
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.099
and yeah, hopefully we can all work together

182
00:08:31.099 --> 00:08:31.932
to make it great.

183
00:08:31.932 --> 00:08:33.670
Have a good day.
