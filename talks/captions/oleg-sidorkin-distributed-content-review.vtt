Hello, I'm Oleg Sidorkin.

2
00:10.200 --> 00:13.540
I'm a Principal Software Architect at Bluescape.

4-p
00:13.540 --> 00:17.740
I'm also one of the developers of co-browsing technology

5
00:17.740 --> 00:23.140
and that's what I'm going to be talking about today.

6
00:23.140 --> 00:26.940
The pandemic and the shift to remote work has challenged

7
00:26.940 --> 00:30.660
the collaboration work landscape all together.

8
00:30.660 --> 00:34.600
When previously gathering a team in one room

9
00:34.600 --> 00:37.340
behind a high definition screen was a no-brainer,

10
00:37.340 --> 00:38.900
today it has become a challenge

11
00:38.900 --> 00:42.420
and probably not coming back anytime soon.

12
00:42.420 --> 00:46.380
Classic video conferencing and assets sharing tools

13
00:46.380 --> 00:49.100
are not adapted for group work when it comes to

14
00:49.100 --> 00:54.900
high fidelity content such as art, animations, and video.

16-p
00:54.900 --> 00:58.660
We at Bluescape created a novel approach

17
00:58.660 --> 01:01.540
where virtually any web site or web enabled tool

18
01:01.540 --> 01:04.940
can gain additional functionality for live co-experience

19
01:04.940 --> 01:08.740
in viewing, commenting and editing creative content.

20
01:08.740 --> 01:12.540
When a user or a team starts a co-browsing session,

21
01:12.540 --> 01:16.580
the desired web site is loaded in the cloud

22
01:16.580 --> 01:20.200
while exact replicas and all incremental changes

23
01:20.200 --> 01:22.500
are broadcasted to all connected clients,

24
01:22.500 --> 01:26.620
giving them the same quality, the same latency,

25
01:26.620 --> 01:29.200
and about the same experience as they would browse

26
01:29.200 --> 01:30.540
the content on their local device

27
01:30.540 --> 01:33.980
or behind the same screen.

29-p
01:33.980 --> 01:36.780
On the server side, we use Chromium as a headless

30
01:36.780 --> 01:40.340
web browser thanks to its open source nature and

31
01:40.340 --> 01:44.340
availability of a mature Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP).

32
01:44.340 --> 01:47.380
Another point to consider was 65% browser

33
01:47.380 --> 01:50.900
market share worldwide earned by Chrome.

34
01:50.900 --> 01:54.580
We selected old fashioned WebSockets as a low latency

35
01:54.580 --> 01:56.820
communication protocol that guarantees

36
01:56.820 --> 01:59.100
in-order messages delivery.

37
01:59.100 --> 02:02.420
The challenges start when we try to capture

38
02:02.420 --> 02:06.260
and deliver a live and exact replica of a web page

39
02:06.260 --> 02:06.940
to the remote client.

41-p
02:08.820 --> 02:12.500
W3C DOM4 introduced MutationObserver deprecating

42
02:12.500 --> 02:15.940
Mutation Events. MutationObserver is a great way to

43
02:15.940 --> 02:18.460
get notified about changes in the DOM,

44
02:18.460 --> 02:20.420
but it doesn't provide enough information

45
02:20.420 --> 02:22.540
to understand what was the exact change

46
02:22.540 --> 02:24.820
and to form an incremental DOM update

47
02:24.820 --> 02:27.620
to be broadcasted to connected clients.

48
02:27.620 --> 02:32.420
We ended up with injected JavaScript code

49
02:32.420 --> 02:36.600
that translates browser DOM into a virtual DOM

50
02:36.600 --> 02:38.500
and computes the difference between the previous

51
02:38.500 --> 02:39.940
and the new version of the virtual DOM.

52
02:39.940 --> 02:45.980
To keep cost of computation at bay,

53
02:45.980 --> 02:49.860
we used persistent data structures and hints

54
02:49.860 --> 02:54.380
from MutationObserver about each area that were affected.

55
02:54.380 --> 02:57.980
The immutability of virtual DOM allowed us to

56
02:57.980 --> 03:01.600
leverage shallow comparison via triple equal

57
03:01.600 --> 03:03.860
JavaScript operator so we can skip analysis

58
03:03.860 --> 03:06.460
of entire sub trees if we know that

59
03:06.460 --> 03:09.780
they will not be affected for sure.

61-p
03:09.780 --> 03:16.260
It works well for almost all DOM elements,

62
03:16.260 --> 03:19.900
but there are some exceptions to take care of.

63
03:19.900 --> 03:21.820
MutationObserver doesn't sense changes in

64
03:21.820 --> 03:24.740
canvas elements and information extraction from

65
03:24.740 --> 03:27.900
canvas context poses its own challenge.

66
03:27.900 --> 03:31.980
We use mixed approach. For less dynamic canvases,

67
03:31.980 --> 03:37.260
like charts, we extract content as data URL

68
03:37.260 --> 03:40.860
that becomes a special attribute in virtual DOM

69
03:40.860 --> 03:43.140
so the same synchronization logic can be used

70
03:43.140 --> 03:46.200
as for regular elements.

71
03:46.200 --> 03:48.580
For canvases with highly dynamic content

72
03:48.580 --> 03:51.420
and specifically for WebGL ones,

73
03:51.420 --> 03:53.140
we have an experimental approach based on

74
03:53.140 --> 03:55.940
captureStream API and WebRTC video streaming.

76-p
03:57.600 --> 04:01.200
The document attached MutationObserver

77
04:01.200 --> 04:03.980
doesn't sense changes in Shadow DOM

78
04:03.980 --> 04:06.540
so every such shadowRoot should be observed individually,

79
04:06.540 --> 04:08.420
which adds additional logistics to

80
04:08.420 --> 04:10.100
the monitoring subsystem but it's solvable.

81
04:10.100 --> 04:16.100
However, additionally, Shadow DOM trees created

82
04:16.100 --> 04:20.500
in closed mode become invisible for JavaScript.

83
04:20.500 --> 04:22.780
In this case we either should give up

84
04:22.780 --> 04:26.780
or we can, and what we do, we monkey-patch

85
04:26.780 --> 04:29.940
attachShadow method of the Element to keep them open.

86
04:29.940 --> 04:36.220
It might contradict certain web site logic but that works.

88-p
04:36.260 --> 04:39.700
When we serve content of a web page to

89
04:39.700 --> 04:43.180
all connected clients,

90
04:43.180 --> 04:45.500
we have to introduce certain modifications to it.

91
04:45.500 --> 04:48.900
We strip out all JavaScript code,

92
04:48.900 --> 04:52.140
effectively making the web page passive and embeddable,

93
04:52.140 --> 04:57.500
so it even can bypass the iframe embed implementations.

94
04:57.500 --> 05:00.600
All JavaScript logic is executed

95
05:00.600 --> 05:01.620
in the cloud in headless browser.

96
05:01.620 --> 05:05.660
We patch links to external assets

97
05:05.660 --> 05:08.340
so all of them are served from the cloud as well.

98
05:08.340 --> 05:10.700
No direct access.

99
05:10.700 --> 05:12.540
Those are target web sites.

100
05:12.540 --> 05:16.140
We infuse event handlers to intercept

101
05:16.140 --> 05:17.740
clients interactions in the page

102
05:17.740 --> 05:20.780
and reroute them to the cloud instance of the web site.

103
05:20.780 --> 05:25.220
Such interception allows us to introduce true co-browsing

104
05:25.220 --> 05:28.540
experience when the single instance of the web site

105
05:28.540 --> 05:32.180
can be effectively controlled and viewed

106
05:32.180 --> 05:34.340
by multiple distributed clients.

108-p
05:34.340 --> 05:38.380
And there are more challenges to come.

110-p
05:38.380 --> 05:43.380
The event handlers distinguish “trusted” events

111
05:43.380 --> 05:44.740
generated by user action

112
05:44.740 --> 05:47.780
and synthetic events generated or modified

113
05:47.780 --> 05:53.140
by script or dispatched via dispatchEvent API.

114
05:53.140 --> 05:56.860
This feature is effectively employed by certain web sites

115
05:56.860 --> 05:58.860
to ensure genuinity of the user input.

116
05:58.860 --> 06:02.140
The workaround we found so far is to dispatch

117
06:02.140 --> 06:05.620
such events through Chrome DevTools protocol.

118
06:05.620 --> 06:11.500
And in this case, they become trusted events.

119-p
06:11.500 --> 06:16.100
Patching of external assets becomes tricky

120
06:16.100 --> 06:19.220
when it comes to malformed content.

121
06:19.220 --> 06:22.540
For example, a browser might ignore a set of errors

122
06:22.540 --> 06:26.220
in CSS file and still displays the valid part

123
06:26.220 --> 06:29.180
while the most of CSS parsing libraries

124
06:29.180 --> 06:32.180
in node.js ecosystem will fail to process it.

125
06:32.180 --> 06:35.340
The current solution that we use is

126
06:35.340 --> 06:40.460
to mimic the browser behavior as close as possible,

127
06:40.460 --> 06:44.540
effectively taking such logic,

128
06:44.540 --> 06:48.100
such CSS code handling from browser's code base,

129
06:48.100 --> 06:49.580
thanks to its open source nature.

131-p
06:49.580 --> 06:55.420
We also found that page synchronization logic is

132
06:55.420 --> 06:57.740
sensitive to intrusive browser extensions,

133
06:57.740 --> 07:03.600
that can be enabled on the client side.

134
07:03.600 --> 07:05.540
Some DOM changes are positional

135
07:05.540 --> 07:08.500
and if an extension altered browser DOM

136
07:08.500 --> 07:11.180
in an unexpected way, the sync protocol

137
07:11.180 --> 07:12.540
might get confused.

138
07:12.540 --> 07:17.300
As a partial mitigation of this issue,

139
07:17.300 --> 07:22.660
we introduced unique identifiers to key DOM elements.

140
07:22.660 --> 07:27.500
JavaScript also doesn't expose object pointers and

141
07:27.500 --> 07:31.380
any kind of object identity, so we used a tree,

142
07:31.380 --> 07:34.900
we leveraged a distinguish property of a Map container

143
07:34.900 --> 07:40.700
where key can be any value including DOM element.

144
07:40.700 --> 07:43.700
Maintaining such a map aside allowed us to introduce

145
07:43.700 --> 07:46.300
unique identitiers and object pointers for DOM elements,

146
07:46.300 --> 07:50.100
and keep the original DOM intact

147
07:50.100 --> 07:56.900
without introducing interference with Web site logic.

149-p
07:56.900 --> 08:02.740
Implementing co-browsers, we faced many challenges,

150
08:02.740 --> 08:06.200
and I described just maybe a quarter of them.

151
08:06.200 --> 08:11.100
A significant part of them is related to limitations

152
08:11.100 --> 08:14.940
or design decisions in corresponding web technologies.

153
08:14.940 --> 08:17.780
And it's understandable because what we're doing is not

154
08:17.780 --> 08:20.580
what you are typically doing.

155
08:20.580 --> 08:23.380
We are trying to implement completely remote

156
08:23.380 --> 08:24.420
browsing experience.

157
08:24.420 --> 08:28.700
For most of such issues, we managed either

158
08:28.700 --> 08:32.740
to find workaround or to introduce certain hacks

159
08:32.740 --> 08:35.940
leveraging dynamic nature of the web stack.

160
08:35.940 --> 08:40.620
So when it works, it works perfect, it works flawlessly.

161
08:40.620 --> 08:45.500
When it doesn't, finding solution is tricky,

162
08:45.500 --> 08:48.540
it feels like walking through a minefield.

163
08:48.540 --> 08:51.860
But at the end, it's doable.

165-p
08:51.860 --> 08:57.940
Thank you.
