          <h3>Integration of media production workflows</h3>
          <p>
            These talks give an overview of media production workflows, the
            opportunity that the web platform brings to this space, and
            architectural and data management design considerations.

                <dd><p>Something unimaginable just 5 years ago has happened: movie and TV production assets are processed and stored in the cloud. In parallel, the web has evolved from text pages with opaque plug-ins to a rich audio-visual medium. The time feels right for professional media production and the web platform to come together.</p></dd>

                <dd><p>Modern productions are a collection of millions of files created by 100s of users around the world to create a single piece of content surrounded by an array of marketing, licensing and distribution needs. In this talk i'll focus on how information moves throughout the creator/production/studio ecosystem. The high velocity of files sizes, types, qualities all with Tier 1 security requirements and real time review expectations create an interesting mix of challenges.</p></dd>

                <dd><p>There are many interoperable solutions for video and audio pipelines that start or terminate in a browser and incorporate ingest, playback, editing and other workflows. When it comes to production metadata associated with video and audio, it's much more of a mess.</p>

<p>Metadata might be standardised like a GPS coordinate or time of day in ISO 8601 format. It might be proprietary like a tripod's gimbal position or characteristics of on-set lighting. Metadata might be bursty, slow and not synchronised to the video like a log of who's in shot or it might be high speed, binary and related to free-running clock like lens position or zoom setting. Metadata might be generated by a device like the velocity of a car, buggy, dolly or crane. Metadata might be derived from on-set stimuli such as the LED wall virtual set velocity.</p>

<p>The only common factor to all of this metadata is that none of it makes it to the VFX / Editor / Mastering suite unless you do a bunch of customs stuff in your workflow. I think we can do better. What do you think?</p></dd>

Using a Media Integration platform will leverage the implementation of these use cases as it will be possible to define these workflows using a LowCode/NoCode paradigm and most importantly future proof.

In this presentation, we discuss how to take advantage of Web Audio API by understanding its architecture and the performance charactereistics. Also it is followed by the introduction of a set of tools named "Web Audio perf toolkit", which allows you to debug, profile, and measure your application from several different angles. We also briefly touches critical problem areas such as privacy and input/output latency.</p></dd>

                <dd><p>For many in broadcast and streaming, WebRTC is not “complete”, as it lacks a standard signaling protocol to make it work like RTMP or RTSP.</p>

<p>WHIP, the WebRTC HTTP Ingest Protocol, was developed to solve the biggest pain point with adopting WebRTC as a serious, professional, robust contribution protocol: Media Ingest. WHIP enables WebRTC to retain its technical advantages over older protocols like RTMP when it comes to resiliency over bad network conditions, adaptability, end-to-end encryption, and new codec support (hello AV1 SVC). It also removes the barrier WebRTC had with a lack of standard signaling protocol that has made it hard to support as a software solution, and difficult for hardware encoders to implement WebRTC.</p>

<p>Developers love WebRTC because it is an IETF & W3C standard that makes it easy to write client applications with native broadcast and playback support on billions of devices worldwide. And the WISH working group at the IETF is currently reviewing WHIP with a milestone to publish it as a standard by December 2021.</p>

<p>Implementing the open source WHIP library in your software or hardware encoder is all you need to support the entire WebRTC stack on the sender side.</p>

<p>It’s time to WHIP WebRTC into shape and take advantage of WebRTC end-to-end, as it was meant to be, natively on every device.</p>

                <dd><p>Clipchamp's mission is to enable everyone to tell stories worth sharing through the power of video. To live up to that goal, we have built a video editor that runs fully in-browser. This also means running the full video processing pipeline on the client and engineering around the challenges that the browser still poses for resource-intensive workloads. Offering access to hardware-accelerated video decoding and encoding, the Clipchamp team has started integrating WebCodecs into our video processing stack early on. In the production version, we wrap the WebCodecs API into custom codec plugins. These form a part of the FFmpeg WebAssembly port that is the beating heart of Clipchamp. This talk covers some of the challenges we encountered along the way and discusses the engineering decisions that we made in response to that. We also make suggestions for some future iterations of the standard, hoping to see it further improve over time.</p></dd>

After decades of efforts in Assembly, C/C++, Java (the Frinika project), finally the Web emerge as a viable path. Combining WebAssembly with Web Audio, he has created a web app for live coding and synthesizing instruments in real time. This was demonstrated at the WebAssembly summit in 2020 and has caught attention in the Web Audio and WebAssembly communities. He is using the app to create music for various digital art projects.</p>

                <dd><p>In the DisneyResarch|Studios (DRS) machine learning pipeline DRS frequently works with production assets in the OpenEXR format. Monitoring the training, inspecting results, and eventually judging the quality of these new approaches require tracking and comparing those assets. DRS decided for an approach where a server provides high dynamic range results as EXR files and compiled OpenEXR using emscripten to allow in-browser decoding and viewing. Using WebGL, simple adjustments and a visualization of per pixel error metrics can be performed by the client on the fly. In this talk, DRS will present the problem, the chosen solution, challenges that DRS has encountered, and demonstrate JERI.io, the web-based EXR viewer, which DRS has released as open source.</p></dd>
